Garden Watering driven by a BeagleBone Black

In order to decide if watering is needed or not, a simple solution is to use a weather data and forecast service. Unless you live in a highly singular place, there is a good chance that the interpolation of data from nearby weather stations will provide more relevant information than a wet cork in your garden. Moreover, this makes it possible to use weather forecast for the next 24h, which are also very likely to be good at telling if there is going to be a real good rain or not.
